# AI’s Software Development Lifecycle — Complete Series

A four-part series by **Quantirax Lab** on how artificial intelligence reshapes the way we **design, build, deploy, and operate** software.  
Each episode includes a short description and a direct link to the video.

## 🎬 Part 1 — Beneath the Hype
**▶️ Watch on YouTube:** [https://youtu.be/YOUR_PART1_ID](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2xyNOwpcL8&t=1s)

Beneath chatbots and copilots is a deeper shift: AI is changing **how core system logic is written and interpreted**.  
We explore the move from brittle, rule-encoded behavior to **reasoning layers** that can interpret ambiguity, respond to edge cases, and learn from feedback.

## 🎬 Part 2 — Decoding AI Terrain
**▶️ Watch on YouTube:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIjxu6HLfjY&t=1s

Not every workflow needs intelligence—and not every system benefits from probabilistic logic.  
This episode maps where AI **belongs** (unstructured inputs, judgment, context) and where **determinism** is the feature (fixed rules, correctness, guarantees).

## 🎬 Part 3 — Architecting Backend Intelligence
**▶️ Watch on YouTube:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpJ0GejWm_M

From hand-written rules to **learned functions**: tasks, data curation, model choice, behavioral testing, and deploying models as **runtime services**.  
We cover confidence thresholds, human-in-the-loop design, contracts, and how learned components compose with deterministic systems.

## 🎬 Part 4 — Operationalizing Backend Intelligence
**▶️ Watch on YouTube:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEj5ht1STV8

Turning intelligence into **infrastructure**: direct service wraps, managed inference runtimes, or fully orchestrated, policy-governed deployments.  
Guardrails (contracts, timeouts, fallbacks), observability (quality, drift, calibration), and how deterministic + probabilistic logic **coexist** in production.
